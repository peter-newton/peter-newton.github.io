My first experience of programming was on an Apple II Plus.  There was a turtle that utilized basic commands to perform various functions.  I recall typing simple commands to move the turtle in different directions, place a pen down to simulate drawing, and loops that required the current line of code to “go to” the initial line.  My sisters never understood the point of the program and found it boring.  I found the process to be utterly fascinating, and explored the possibilities of my imagination.

With the advent of commercial video games and the internet, this further tantalized my desire to produce a product that provides a service to people.  This service could be for entertainment, production, or a means to solve a problem.  After glancing through the different technical professions for which to invest in, software engineering seemed to be the one best suited for my desires.  I want to write programs.  I want people to use the programs that I write to assist in their everyday lives.  I want my programs to change the world.

The main thing that I am looking for in my pursuit to be a programmer, is that I want to have an awareness of the vast number of tools to utilize when creating software.  If a system uses C++, I want to be proficient in C++.  If an app uses JavaScript, I want to be proficient in JavaScript.  I want to have the flexibility to switch different tool sets in order to accomplish a job.  

Along with the knowledge of having these toolsets, I expect to develop the confidence in using these tools.  My confidence would increase my efficiency.  If I am ill-confident, then time is wasted sifting through my notes and books to find the answer I need.  I believe this will be the longest and hardest hurdle to overcome, but it will be essential in order for me to achieve that comfort level in which I desire.
